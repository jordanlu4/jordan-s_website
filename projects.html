            <h3>Gym Simulator Game (C++)</h3>
            <p>This is one of my first projects to showcase what I've learned from my first semester as a computer
                science major.
                The goal of this game is to buy gear and challenge various bodybuilders of different ratings
                and win in order to beat the game. If the 3 time reigning Mr. Olyympia Chris Bumstead reaches level 50
                before you
                beat the bosses, you lose the game. This is just a quick fun game that I'm proud to have created. </p>

            <h3>Workout Program (Python) </h3>
                    <p>This is an early-stage python program I'm writing. Through this program, users can follow my
                        7-day workout program that guides them through each workout, allows you to swap exercises,
                        choose what workout you want to do and how to do them, and track progress</p>

            <h3>Spotify Script (Python) </h3>
            <p>
                This is a small little script I made in Python that creates a small GUI that displays your current Spotify song and artist. This script allows you to pause, play, press next, and rewind. To make it work, you must visit https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard, create an account if you don't have one, create an app, and replace the ID and Secret.

            <h3>Spotify Wrapped (Python) </h3>
            <p>
                This is another spotify script I wrote in python that acts like the yearly "Spotify Wrapped" feature. With this program, you won't have to wait. At your command, you have the ability to check your top artists and tracks within a certain period, and turn it into a playlist on your actual spotify application!
